        <p>This is a rough draft for a local Llandudno business. All static information and no animations or micro-interactions yet as I am waiting on feedback and amendment request from the owner. Suggestions I made are minimal javascript reliance and also that we can breakout the different sections into their own seperate pages. Still under constructions</p>

        <p>This is a more complete site that is mobile ready. This was to replace the existing site I did for them back in 2016 but they have since began to wind down. Color scheme was chosen by the client and I used multiple methods for micro animations. CSS based, JavaScript based using the Intersection Observer API and another using the AOS framework which made them very easy.</p> 
            
        <p>I prefer to avoid the frameworks to keep the sites lite and easy to modify. Also since the info on the site is mostly static I tend not to use Gulp.js or Webpack as this would be overkill and with the leave the code unminified for Github allowing easy inspection.</p>

        <p>This was an effort to convince my old flatmate that the same effect can be done with vanilla html & CSS as with Wordpress. Also trying to convince her that there are no restrictions that way as with Wordpress. I like the control that codeing every pixel of a website gives me. Wordpress does a great job for some people but I prefer to design every inch of a site so I can learn as much as I can. </p>

Should this ever be ressurected I will renew my efforts to revamp this site to avoid the monotony of Wordpress and 'current trends' where all the sites look the same. Bootstrap-free with anything that a professional designer can concieve is my preference for this as it is a very different kind of content.  </p>

        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>I was born and bred in Scotland and worked in Ullapool, Germany  and New York before studying Ancient History and Philosophy at the University of Edinburgh for 2 years. I then moved to the Netherlands where I spent the next ten years developing business skills such as managing people and technical skills such as Web Developement and data management. I now live in the beautiful town of Llandudno in North Wales. </p>
        
        <p>Currently I am continuing to develop my Web Development skills in an effort to convert them from amateur to a more professional level. I am currently working to improve many websites as personal projects and learning opportunities. I have also continued to learn by earning certificates from online learning services such as Linkedin Learning and EDX. I have also learned a lot from volunteering at the CSFLeak.uk charity as a digital administrator.</p>
        
        <p>My personal interests are mainly taking new courses in webdev tools I am interested in such as Vue, Cyber Security and MongoDB. NBA and playing guitar. </p>

    </div>

    <div class="box abox11">

        <h2>Web Development Profile</h2>

        <p>I prefer to use a Debian Linux platform. I use <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">VS Code</a> and <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/" target="_blank">Sublime-Text</a> mainly but also use <a href="https://atom.io/" target="_blank">Atom</a> when dealing with more than one project at a time. Normally I will use terminal based tools via <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/" target="_blank">NPM</a> and <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" target="_blank">Node.js</a>. For larger projects I use <a href="https://gulpjs.com/" target="_blank">Gulp.js</a>. I prefer to keep reliance on JavaScript to a minimum and to use as many SASS/CSS solutions as I can for security and reliability reasons.</p>
        
        <p>I also like to avoid frameworks such as bootstrap and jQuery to keep the sites I build as light as possible and to avoid monotony of appearance. Also for reasons of learning to code specific features myself.</p>

        <h2>Cyber Security & Data Privacy</h2>
        <p>I am a firm believer in taking some basic security precautions for all users to avoid difficulty no matter the level of threat. However depending on the threat model you fit with there are other important tools available that may be ncessary. I have put together some of my recommendations on the tools page of this site so if you feel you are interested in taking more active measures please have a look <a href="tools.html">here</a> 
        </p>
        
        <p>For a very thorough discussion on the subject and far more information I would recommend visiting the <a href="https://restoreprivacy.com/">Restore Privacy</a>  website. They have many informative reviews and useful advice for your considerations.</p>

        <h2>Note:</h2>
        <p>If you don't already know the links I encourage you to explore their value. They are some of the handy online resources that I tend to use and are only suggestions. Everyone has their own set of favourites but searching the web with questions should lead you to the answer, or 10 answers and sometimes a lot more. This is the main way I learn.</p>
        
        <p>CSS Tricks is great for new styling solutions. Rapid Table, MDN and W3C are all great technical reference sites. Google Fonts and Font Awesome are excellent for your site typography. Codepen and Github contain a lot of example code to explore. Stack Overflow and ES Lint will help you solve issues. Node and Gulp will familiarise you with great automation tools. Unsplash is a great source of images. Clippy helps you quickly get the code you need for creating custom shapes. When testing your site Can I Use may clarify why something isn't working by checking which browsers may need a polyfil to work.</p>
        
        <p>I would also recommend courses from <a href="https://www.udemy.com/user/jonasschmedtmann/" target="_blank">Jonas Schmedtmann</a> & <a href="https://www.udemy.com/user/brad-traversy/" target="_blank">Brad Traversy</a> on Udemy and Gary Simon at <a href="https://designcourse.com/" target="_blank">Design Course</a>.</p>
