        <p>&laquo;Alan is one of the best Supervisors/Team Leaders I have ever worked with. His positive and cheerful attitude and personal motivation are what separates him from his peers. He is honest in his opinion and will learn/get to know his business in order to get the job done right. Headstrong at times, something considered as a good trait to me, but always open for input with one mutual goal. Solving the issue and learning in the process. His charisma is something that carries over to the people he directs, who find themselves not wanting to disappoint him. A trait found in the best of leaders. All in all, I believe Alan would be a welcome and valuable addition to any company.&raquo;</p>

        <p>&laquo;I had the privilege to work with Alan as his colleague at Laureate Online Education. Alan is a hard-working individual who knows how to get the job done quickly and effectively. He works well as a part of a team and can function as a leader when required. He has always exhibited superior communication skills and gets along well with all colleagues across different departments. He is highly respected by colleagues, customers and management. 
            He displays excellent problem solving and analytical skills. He works smart and efficient. Alan is definitely not afraid to take risks and often suggests new directions to explore. In addition to his general duties, he significantly contributed to successful implementation of system and procedural changes within the operations department that positively influenced overall customer experience. He is always eager to learn and work well within multicultural environment. I find him a great colleague and wish him well for his future professional development.&raquo;</p>

        <p>&laquo;I have worked with Alan very closely for close to 5 years, half of which we have worked for the same department. Alan's role was critical to the day to day running of the key operations and processes and in his role, keeping good relationships with other dept, having an analytical eye and ability to rationalize under stress, were critical. I can truly say that Alan's contribution was invaluable, particularly his practical and logical take on various issues we would come across. He posses great analytical skills which paired with a knack for numbers and analytical tools, will be a good addition to any organization. As a colleague in the same team, I will miss Alan's support and always happy to give a helping hand or debate about a problem and solution. Cheerful, in the Scotish sense, I valued working with Alan and whilst I wish him all the success in a new job, he is certainly a loss in ours.&raquo;</p>

        <p>&laquo;Eager and passionate is what comes to mind when I think of Alan. Alan doesn't stop when a job is done but is continuously looking at ways to improve processes and reports. Alan's key skill is his ability to successfully problem solve and he has demonstrated this on numerous occasions, which has been vital when working across departments. He has a keen eye for efficiency and works closely with team members around him to improve the teams overall knowledge and functionality. Alan has played a substantial role in the instrumental success of our team, leading and documenting process changes and navigating uncharted ground. What sets Alan apart from others is that he is always one step ahead and goes out of his way to learn new software, having recently taken a driving lead to enhance his salesforce knowledge. I am continually inspired by Alan's technical abilities and his positive attitude towards training others.&raquo;</p>
